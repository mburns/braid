This is the configuration for twistedmatrix.com's trac installation

It is adminstered using braid[1]. It is installed in `/srv/trac` as user trac.
It uses the following directories

~/config - This repository.
~/config/trac-env - Trac environment
~/config/htpasswd - Trac passwords
~/bin - commands to start and stop the server
~/log - log files
~/run - pid files
~/attachments - trac attachments
~/svn/Twisted - mirror of svn repo for trac
~/website - containst a checkout of t-web

It uses the copy of trac from
https://github.com/twisted-infra/twisted-trac-source
and the plugin from
https://github.com/twisted-infra/twisted-trac-plugins

This currently depends on the binaries (message, ticket) from
https://github.com/twisted-infra/kenaan
living at
`/srv/kenaan/bin/*`

An svn post-commit hook updates the repository at `~/svn/Twisted`
and notifies trac via a pb-server run from the monitor script.

The following fabric commands are available:

install - Create user and install configuration.
update - Updates the configuration and restarts the server.
start - Start server.
stop - Stop server.
restart - Restart the server.
dump:<dump-file> - Dump trac db and attachments
restore:<dump-file> - Restore trac db and attachments
