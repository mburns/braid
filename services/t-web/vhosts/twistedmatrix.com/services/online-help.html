<h1>Getting Help Online</h1>

<p>While we'd love for you to pay us to do it, the Twisted developers
are likely to be online and able to answer any questions you might
have regarding the framework.  Realize, before you make any
unreasonable demands through these channels, that there <em>are</em>
people who are paying some of us for this, and so we don't have to
take any crap from you for free :-).</p>

<p> Real-time help is available with Internet Relay Chat.  Likely
hangouts are #twisted and #twisted.web (for web-related Twisted-based
technologies) on <a href="http://freenode.net">the FreeNode
Network</a>.</p>

<p> If you have any patience, you can increase the chances that your
question is heard by using <a
href="/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">the general discussion
mailing list</a> and/or <a
href="/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-web">the twisted-web mailing
list</a>. Please subscribe first, then post a query about your
problem; we will try to answer promptly.  The list is relatively low
in traffic.  </p>
