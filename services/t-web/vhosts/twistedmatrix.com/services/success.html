<h1> Success Stories </h1>

<h2>Botonomy LLC</h2>
<p>
Botonomy LLC is a small software firm in the Philadelphia area.  We
help small teams solve large problems.
</p>

<p>Our first
application, <a href="http://www.projectpipe.com">ProjectPipe</a>, is
a hosted project management solution that provides midsize teams with
everything that they need to manage IT projects.  We have built our
hosted application infrastructure atop Twisted, Nevow, PostgreSQL, and
Jabber/XMPP.  Twisted's multi-protocol support has been one of the key
enablers of the unique technical architecture that we employ in our
product offerings.
</p>

<p>The core Twisted development team consistently demonstrates a strong
commitment to delivering robust, high quality software.  Twisted's
documentation is accurate and concise, and the expertise and
helpfulness of the larger developer community is second-to-none.
</p>

<p>When evaluating the technologies on which you are staking your
business, you need to evaluate both the code and the community that
surrounds it.  Twisted passes with flying colors in both regards. 
</p>

<p>-- Christian Simms, Botonomy LLC</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.reflexionsdata.com/">Reflexions Data</a></h2>
<p>At Reflexions Data, we provide custom development services for a
wide variety of clients. We recently completed work on a project for a
new client; the timeframe available required us to expedite every step
of the development process. Twisted allowed us to quickly implement a
custom client/server protocol with a wide variety of extra
functionality <q>for free</q>.</p>

<p>The quality of the Twisted networking core is unmatched in the
open- or closed-source arenas. Due largely to its asynchronous
networking model, we were able to ensure our clients scalability needs
would be met.</p>

<p>Our experiences with the Twisted developer community were top-
notch; the turnaround time on questions posted to the developer
mailing list was simply amazing. We were so pleased with the results
of our first professional use of the Twisted core that we plan on
investigating how we can make use of the other facets of the Twisted
project.</p>

<p>-- Phil Christensen, Senior Developer, Reflexions Data, LLC</p>

<h2> <a href="http://www.mastersofbranding.com/">Masters of Branding</a> </h2>

<p>At Masters of Branding we use Twisted as the networking core for all of our client and server RFID software.  It was by far the easiest framework to develop with, debug under, and extend for our purposes to support protocols such as SOAP, HTTP, and Macromedia Flash-compatible XML Sockets.  The API and event model are both very well thought out and has accommodated all of our networking needs from database-heavy server software on Linux to (py)OpenGL visualization applications on win32.</p>

<p>The ease and power of Python and Twisted really showed through when we took one of our applications developed in and for Linux and ported it to run as a Windows NT service in less than day.  New users to the framework will not only be impressed by the power of the software, but also that the developer/user community responsible for it are incredibly helpful and often provide much better support in minutes or hours than you'll see from commercial shops given days or weeks.</p>

<p>-- Bob Ippolito, CTO, Masters of Branding Inc.</p>


<h2> NASA </h2>

<p>My team is developing a modular application to integrate CAD/CAE/CAM 
tools and data and to enable collaboration among distributed teams of 
engineers working on NASA projects.  We have selected Twisted as our 
framework because of its pluggable, asynchronous protocols, support 
for multiple interfaces and protocols per service, integration with 
PostgreSQL, and just generally excellent layered architecture.</p>

<p>-- Stephen C. Waterbury, NASA</p>


<h2> <a href="http://adelux.c2a.fr/">Adelux</a> </h2>

<p>Adelux develops custom internet applications such as portals,
network security tools, communication-related programs,
and software that leverages other systems.</p>

<p>We discovered Twisted 10 months ago, and now it is a key
element of our development strategy. We have successfully used Twisted on several
projects, of very different problem domains.</p>

<p>We developed a highly scalable realtime application for
customer support, which serves web-based clients as well as clients
implemented in any of the many protocols supported by
Twisted. Twisted was also used to develop targeted proxies for various
applications supporting more than 15.000 users. Twisted handles
the charge with no problem.</p>

<p>We intend to continue using Twisted on upcoming projects, especially
since integrated support for databases and new services are being
added very quickly.</p>

<p>We  found Twisted to be powerful, comprehensible,
well documented, and backed by a good helpful community. We'll use it on our 
next products for sure!</p>

<p>-- Luc Stepniewski, Head Engineer, Adelux, France</p>


<h2> <a href="http://www.list.org">Mailman</a> </h2>

<p>I wanted to test out some news/mail gatewaying for Mailman 2.1 but I
didn't want to go through the hassle of actually connecting things up
to a real news server, and I /definitely/ didn't want to actually try
to install inn or some nonsense (I'd like to do some other work this
week :).</p>

<p>I wished I had something like Lib/smtpd.py in the Python distro for
the server side of NNTP, then it dawned on me that I remember Moshe
and crew saying that Twisted comes with a news server.  Well, let's
just see how easy it would be to hook up.</p>

<p>You guys have a big problem, because it was /way/ too easy to do!  How
are you going to make the big consulting bucks? :)</p>

<p>Three commands and I had an nntp server with a single newsgroup that
was featured enough to connect Mozilla to, and to point Mailman's
gateway at and actually get messages flowing back and forth.
Congratulations!</p>

<p>-- Barry Warsaw</p>


<h2> MC-Foo and Ldaptor </h2>

<p>I was writing MC Foo (http://mc-foo.sf.net/), a networked multiuser
learning Ogg/MP3 jukebox application, in C, and was frustrated about
the amount of time it took to debug. I decided I should use a
higher-level language. I liked how Python felt, but had never written
a single line of Python. I decided it was time to learn. Five hours
later, the core of my application was rewritten in Python, using
Twisted for main loop and networking. Another five hours later, I had
replaced my oversimplistic line-based protocols with PB, the Twisted
RPC protocol. Twisted has also enabled me to easily add features such
as implicit persistence into MC Foo. And it even has nice GUI
integration, allowing one to do sane networking in a GUI application.</p>

<p>Since then, I have created Ldaptor (http://ldaptor.bkbits.net/), a
pure-Python LDAP library, utilities and a web interface, as a data
structure library, Twisted protocol and Twisted applications. The way
how the web interface plugs in with the LDAP protocol handling still
manages to amaze me.</p>

<p>The developer community behind Twisted is just great, and the IRC
channel is a great source of information. All in all, I feel Twisted
is one of the most interesting projects on the net.</p>
