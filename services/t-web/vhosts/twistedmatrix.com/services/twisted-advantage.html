<h1>The Twisted Advantage</h1>

<h2>Flexibility</h2>

<p>Twisted's codebase is small and it contains many hooks for dynamic
content.  With the source code and an open license, you know you'll
never be in a position where you can't add a feature you need. </p>

<h2><a name="#security">Security</a></h2>

<p>
Twisted is written in <a href="python">Python, a high-level
language</a>, rendering it immune to the most common class of security
flaw in network software, the "buffer overflow": buffer overflows have
allowed worms and crackers to tamper with or disable internet servers.
Twisted also takes advantage of operating-system security features
whenever possible, delegating responsibility for tasks to the
appropriate user to make the system more difficult to exploit.  </p>

<h2>Stability</h2>

<p>Thanks again to <a href="python">Python's</a> error handling
mechanisms, the Twisted server framework is extremely stable.  Even
the most bleeding-edge development servers -- those we run here at <a
href="http://twistedmatrix.com">twistedmatrix.com</a> -- don't crash,
and rarely (if ever) need to be restarted.  </p>

<p>But where do these advantages help you directly?  Twisted can do a
lot, so it depends on what you're using it for.  Let's take a look at
some potential applications you might have in mind...  </p>

<h1>As a User, You Can:</h1>

<h2>Publish a Web Site</h2>

<p>The <a href="../products/web">twisted.web</a> webserver is a scalable,
small-footprint web server that's easy to configure.  It's efficient
enough to serve a high-traffic website, completely dynamic and
reconfigureable on the fly, and simple enough to configure that you
can have it set up and running in just minutes after you've downloaded
it.  It's also portable, so you can easily share your web content
between Windows, Unix, Macintosh, and other systems, all running
twisted.web.  It also shares the <a href="#security">security</a>
advantages of the rest of Twisted.
</p>

<p>Twisted Web scales down as well as up.  Use it to share files with
your friends at home or to publish large files on your enterprise
intranet.</p>

<h1>As a Developer, You Can:</h1>

<h2>Develop servers at lightning speed...</h2>

<p>Twisted integrates a large number of consistent APIs for
developing new Internet services.  This translates to a wide number of
protocols and components that are ready to work with your new server
before you've written the first line of code. </p>

<p> In addition to legacy protocol support, the <a
href="../products/spread">twisted.spread</a> package allows developers
to quickly develop new protocols and services with arbitrarily complex
interfaces, prototyping new client functionality on the fly.</p>

<p> What does this mean in terms of development time?  If you're
developing a new server, it could take literally a year off of your
implementation time -- and that's just now.  Twisted development is
proceeding at a rapid pace, and by the time you've finished your
development you may find a host of new features that you didn't have
to spend a moment thinking about!</p>

<p>Twisted comes under a relatively non-restrictive open-source
license, making it suitable for both commercial and open-source
development.</p>

<h2>... and clients too.</h2>

<p> Unlike some other server frameworks, Twisted makes it simple to
develop a client using the same code-base.  Whether you are developing
both a client and server in tandem with the twisted.spread package, or
independently developing a client for an existing protocol, Twisted's
integration with a wide variety of different graphical toolkits will
allow you to run any common code completely unchanged from your server
environment.</p>

<h2>Engage an Active Community</h2>

<p>Twisted has a knowledgeable, energetic, and growing developer
community.  Members of this community have concern over issues like
those you will be facing in your custom server development and have
solved those issues for themselves already within the Twisted
framework.</p>

<p>We (the developers of Twisted) try to use every piece of the
software we write ourselves -- after all, the reason we wrote it was
that we needed it! This means that if there's a bug, we're concerned
about it. Twisted comes with a full set of automated acceptance tests
and unit tests.</p>
