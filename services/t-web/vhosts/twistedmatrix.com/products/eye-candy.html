<h1>Eye Candy</h1>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>
<p>
Every project's gotta have 'em.  Twisted is particularly difficult to take a
real <q>screenshot</q> of, since it usually lives under the hood.  I've taken
some screenshots of various Twisted applications in order to give you a feel
for what it makes possible.
</p>

<div align="center"><img id="twistd" src="../images/screenshots/basic-twistd.png" /></div>

<p> Here's my personal web server starting up, handling one request, and
shutting down in a terminal.  You can see a few things here.

<ol>
  
  <li>It's really easy to start up - no special installation procedure, just
  run <q>twistd</q> from wherever it's located on a pickled application
  object. </li>

  <li>Twisted automatically handles daemonization and logging for you; you can
  see it sheds root privileges immediately and automatically when it does not
  absolutely require them.</li>

  <li>Signal handling is automatic; your objects get startup/shutdown messages
  at the appropriate times.</li>

  <li>Configuration is automatically saved upon shutdown, in case it
  changed while you were running and you want to keep the changes.</li>
  
</ol>

That's all rather dry, though.  If you're looking for something snazzier, here
are some screenshots of Instance Messenger.
</p>

<div align="center"><img id="imSelAcct" src="../images/screenshots/im-accountselect.png"
/></div>

<p>Here you can see selection of different accounts.</p>
<div align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">
      <img im="imNewWords" src="../images/screenshots/im-newaccount-twisted.png" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img im="imNewIRC" src="../images/screenshots/im-newaccount-irc.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img im="imNewAOL" src="../images/screenshots/im-newaccount-aol.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>

<p>... and dialogs for creating all the different kinds of accounts that
Twisted can access.</p>


<div align="center"><img id="imContacts" src="../images/screenshots/im-personselect.png" />
</div>

<p>Once we're logged in, we can see who's online, and choose who to talk
to. </p>

<div align="center"><img id="imChat" src="../images/screenshots/im-conversation.png" />
</div>

<p>If time permits, we can talk to them.</p>


<div align="center"><img id="imGroup" src="../images/screenshots/im-groupconversation.png"
/> </div>

<p>IM doesn't skimp on group conversation features: we can chat with groups
just as easily as with individuals.  (The buttons on the right might indicate
to the observant reader that some functionality is still a bit raw... but we're
working on it.)</p>

<h2>Haberdashery</h2>

<p>We also have an official <a

pattern</a>.  For T-Shirts and such, you can look at the <a

store</a>. </p>
