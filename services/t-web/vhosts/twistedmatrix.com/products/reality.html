      Twisted Reality is a library designed to quickly produce text-based,
      interactive, fictional worlds.  The main focus of this project is not to
      write a MUD server, but rather to expand the genre of interactive fiction
      into multi-player.  This is an ambitious task, and we don't think that it
      will be done overnight!  However, quite a few interesting tangents have
      arisen from this project (including the web server you're viewing this
      page through).

      Currently, it does most basic MOOish stuff (live editing of objects, room
      descriptions, etc), but lacks an advanced standard library and coding
      examples.  Contributions would be graciously accepted :-)

      Unfortunately, there are no releases of Reality at this time. It
      is available through <a href="/developers/cvs">anonymous SVN</a> in the
      'Imagination' module, but please don't expect too much. There are a few games
      based on Reality at the moment, but none have been released.
