<h1>Twisted.Cred</h1>

<p>Cred is a pluggable authentication system for servers.  It allows any
number of network protocols to connect and authenticate to a system, and
communicate to those aspects of the system which are meaningful to the specific
protocol.  For example, Twisted's POP3 support passes a <q>username and
password</q> set of credentials to get back a mailbox for the specified email
account.  IMAP does the same, but retrieves a slightly different view of the
same mailbox, enabling those features specific to IMAP which are not available
in other mail protocols.</p>

<p>Cred is designed to allow both the backend implementation of the business
logic - called the <em>avatar</em> - and the authentication database - called
the <em>credential checker</em> - to be decided during deployment. For example,
the same POP3 server should be able to authenticate against the local UNIX
password database or an LDAP server without having to know anything about how
or where mail is stored.  </p>
