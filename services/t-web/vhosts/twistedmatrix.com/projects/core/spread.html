<h1>Twisted Spread</h1>

<p> Twisted Spread is a package of modules that support "spreadable computing".
(Note that this is our notion of 'spread' -- I was unaware of <a
href="http://www.spread.org/">The Spread Toolkit</a> when I named it, and it is
not related.)</p>

<p> Twisted's notion of "spreadable" computing is distinct from distributed
computing in that it doesn't attempt to solve issues of transparency; nor to
seamlessly and fluidly move computation from one site to another, or migrate
objects. Twisted Spread facilitates communication between objects in distinct
locations.
</p>

<p>If you're writing servers that need to communicate with each other, or new
client/server programs, twisted.spread in general and the Perspective Broker
protocol specifically are probably good solutions for your problems.  </p>

<p>The components that Twisted Spread provides are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="#pb">pb</a>: pb is the Perspective Broker.
  It lets you talk to remote objects, implementing semantics for object
  copying, caching, and referencing. </li>
  <li> <a href="#jelly">jelly</a>: serialization for Python objects </li>
  <li> <a href="#banana">banana</a>: low level data marshaller </li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="pb">Perspective Broker</a></h2>

<p> Perspective Broker is a broker for proxies for and copies of objects.
It provides a translucent interface layer to those proxies. </p>

<p> The protocol is not opaque, because it provides objects which
represent the remote proxies and require no context (server
references, IDs) to operate on. </p>

<p> It is not transparent because it does *not* attempt to make remote
objects behave identically, or even similiarly, to local objects.
Method calls are invoked asynchronously, and specific rules are
applied when serializing arguments. </p>

<p> PB relies upon <a href="#jelly">Jelly</a> for object serialization
and <a href="#banana">Banana</a> for the byte-level encoding of data.
It also defines a specialized profile for Banana to reduce network
bandwidth usage for the common string constants used within the PB
protocol. </p>

<p> PB also builds upon the authentication framework provided by <a
href="cred">Twisted Cred</a>. </p>

<h2><a name="jelly">Jelly</a></h2>

<p> Jelly is the serializer used by Perspective Broker.  It converts
Python objects into lists of strings and numbers, deferring to an
encoder (Banana) to encode them. </p>

<p> The main goals of Jelly are: </p>

<ul>
    <li> Security and safety: Perspective Broker may receive
         requests from hostile sources with invalid data. The process
         of unjellying invalid data must not execute arbitrary code,
         crash the interpreter, or do other similarly bad things.  In
         the past, security issues have been a <a
         href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.2.3/lib/pickle-sec.html"
         >concern for Pickle</a>.  </li>
    <li> Language Neutrality: Implementations of the Perspective
         Broker exist in multiple languages, so the serialization
         strategy and formats must not be Python-specific. This rules
         out traditional Python modules like Pickle and Marshal. </li>
</ul>

<p> Specifications and a high-performance C implementation of Jelly will
be forthcoming. </p>


<h2><a name="banana">Banana</a></h2>

<p> Banana (Banana Allows Network Abstraction Nearly Always) is the
low-level marshaller created to support Jelly and the Perspective
Broker.  It encodes a limited set of datatypes into a space efficient
network transportable form.  The details of the datatypes and the
nature of the encoding are all cover in the <a
href="../documents/specifications/banana.html">specifications</a>.</p>

<p> Banana is extensible through the addition of "profiles" which allow
an application to customize Banana for peak space efficiency by special
encoding data streams in an application (profile) specific manner.  The
standard Twisted distribution includes support for two profiles, "none"
and "pb".  The "none" profile does no work to carry out extra compression
while the "pb" profile supports the compression of the strings generated
by Jelly into integers. </p>

<p> The <a href="../documents/specifications/banana.html">Banana
Specifications</a> are available.  Twisted includes both a Python
and a high performance C implementation. </p>


<h2>Availability</h2>

<p> In addition to the Python reference implementation in Twisted,
an interoperable version of Perspective Broker for Java and the
beginning of an Emacs Lisp version are available from the <a
href="download">downloads page</a>.  Implementations for other
languages are in progress.</p>
