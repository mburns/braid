<h1>Twisted.Internet</h1>

<h2>Overview and Features</h2>

<p> Twisted is an asynchronous networking framework.  It provides the tools
that you need to write client and server networking applications that don't
require a large number of threads to scale. </p>

<h3><a name="reactor">Reactor-based Main Loop</a></h3>

<p> Twisted Internet uses the <a
href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~eliens/online/oo/I/2/reactor.html"
>Reactor Pattern</a> for its event architecture.  There are many pluggable
implementations of the reactor for integrating with various toolkits
and other event loops (more information can be found in the 
<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/reactor-basics.html">Reactor Basics</a>
document). </p>

<h3><a name="gui-integration">GUI Integration</a></h3>

<p> GUI integration: Our Reactor design is "pluggable", allowing us
to integrate various toolkits into Twisted. You can run servers or
clients in a Twisted process and not have to worry about threading
or conflicting event loops. What this means is that you can have a
client or server running in a GUI, so implementing a user interface
for your Twisted-based applications is easy! Currently Twisted
integrates with PyGTK, WxPython, Tkinter, and PyQT.</p>

<h3><a name="async-utils">Asynchronous Programming Utilities</a></h3>

<p> Twisted provides a number of utilities for simplifying
common asynchronous programming idioms. This includes tools for
managing thread pools and support for 'deferred' operations which
will execute in the future, and without blocking the main
process. </p>

<h3><a name="persistence">Persistent Servers</a></h3>

<p> Servers can be persistent; there need not be configuration files, only
pickles of the state of the server as you run it last.</p>

<h3><a name="common-daemon">twistd - A Built-in Daemon</a></h3>

<p> '<code>twistd</code>' is the Twisted Daemon.  It is a simple tool
designed in a UNIX and command-line friendly way; however it is portable
to many environments (including Win32).  It can take care
of many common tasks for you including: </p>

<ul>
  <li> Daemonization on UNIX platforms, with support for services
       on Windows NT/2000/XP in the future. </li>
  <li> Logging. </li>
  <li> Loading and execution of serialized Twisted application objects
       in any of the serialization formats supported by Twisted. </li>
  <li> Saving a currently running Twisted application to a serialized
       object to be loaded by <code>twistd</code> in the future. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="protocol-support">Wide Ranging Protocol Support</a></h3>

<p> We are replacing various UNIX daemons as we go along; all of these
services are designed to be friendly to other Python code and the Twisted
framework. This includes the HTTP, IRC, POP3, SMTP, and Telnet
implementations, which are fairly good examples of where we plan to
take this.</p>

<h2>Competition</h2>

<h3>Asyncore</h3>

<p> <a href="http://python.org/doc/lib/module-asyncore.html">Asyncore</a>
is a asynchronous networking library that is part of the Python standard
library.  It is a partial solution which mainly provides low-level networking
support, leaving out many pieces of an industrial-strength asynchronous
framework. Asyncore is also only being minimally maintained. </p>
