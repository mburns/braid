improvements to Woven. Paul has been his usual insanely-productive

  Twisted 0.99.0 is out! This marks the beginning of the preparation period for 1.0: No API changes will be

  bugs.

  Here's what's new in 0.99.0:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Paul Swartz contributed Twisted Conch, an SSHv2 implementation.</li>

    <li>Twisted Zoot, an implementation of Gnutella for Twisted, was written
    by Bryce "zooko" Wilcox-O'Hearn.</li>

    <li>Rewritten connection APIs to make writing clients with Twisted easier.</li>

    <li> A "Pager" for Twisted Spread allowing one to easily stream large 
    amounts of data with Perspective Broker.</li>

    <li>A new FreeBSD Kqueue reactor (mainloop implementation) contributed by
    Matt Campbell.</li>

    <li>Refactored Authorizers and Application so twisted.internet has no
    dependance on twisted.cred.</li>

    <li>Many API cleanups, tons of bugfixes, and more documentation as usual.</li>

    <li>Added a new MVC-based web framework.</li>

  cReactor, which is an implementation of the Twisted Reactor interface in C. Oh, and did we mention

We're going to start doing release candidates (that's what the "rc" stands for) before major releases from now on, so you don't have to fear
