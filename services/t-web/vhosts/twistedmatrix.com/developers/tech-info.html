<h1>Technical Specifications</h1>

<h2>Basic Information</h2>

<p> Twisted is an asynchronous networking framework written in Python.
It has a pluggable main-loop which can run anywhere from <code>poll()</code>
on Linux in CPython, to polling emulated with threads on Jython.  </p>

<p> In the development of Twisted, we use <a
href="http://www.xprogramming.com">eXtreme programming</a> (to the
extent that one can do so without a single requirements-setting
"customer"), so there exist <a href="../documents/current/howto/test-standard"
>Unit Tests for much of the codebase</a>. </p>

<p> It is designed to interfere as little as possible with existing
code; if your application is already event based, then integrating
Twisted may be only the work of one afternoon. </p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<p> Currently, we have a specification for the <a
href="../documents/current/specifications/banana.html">Banana protocol</a> that is part
of <a href="../products/spread">Twisted Spread</a>. Further specifications
will be forthcoming to encourage interoperability at the protocol level
with Twisted. </p>

<h2>Call for Benchmarks</h2>

<p> Twisted anecdotally benchmarks "well enough" but we need more hard
numbers.  If you have some technical information you want to
contribute we'd love to host it here.  We also welcome <a href="contributing"
>contributions</a> of benchmarking test suites. </p>
